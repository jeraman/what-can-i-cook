# Look and feel
Time has come to make the app look 'fancier'. A traditional approach for improving 'look and feel' is pure HTML and CSS. However, there are today many well-known frameworks to help us in this task. Examples are:

- [Bootstrap:](https://getbootstrap.com/) One of the most popular solutions out there. Bootstraps is open-source, supports several [different interface components](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components), and is first designed to be lightweight (for mobiles). One nice introductory tutorial can be found [here](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components). Some people have even created a [library](https://ng-bootstrap.github.io/#/home) to improve Bootstrap integration with Angular.

- [Angular Materials:](https://material.angular.io/) A fancy name for sure! While not as popular as Bootstrap, it has the benefit of having a nice integration with Angular. Designed after [Google's Material Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design).

- [DIY, of course!](https://www.taniarascia.com/you-dont-need-a-framework/) That will help you to improve your knowledge in the fundamentals of responsive design with HTML and CSS!

Alternatives to these solutions can be found on [this post](https://hackr.io/blog/top-bootstrap-alternatives).

## Angular Materials
I decided to give Angular Materials a try. I just loved [Google's Material Design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_Design) proposal: It's a bit abstract, but seems less web-specific and potentially extensible to other contexts. Moreover, Materials' components such as [Cards](https://material.angular.io/components/card/examples) and [Chips](https://material.angular.io/components/chips/overview) seems pretty suited to this project.

First, I used [this short guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/getting-started) to setup things and get going.
